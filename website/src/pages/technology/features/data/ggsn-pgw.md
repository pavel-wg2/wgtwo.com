# GGSN/PGW

Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is part of the core network that connects GSM-based 3G networks to the Internet. The GGSN, sometimes known as a wireless router, works in tandem with the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) to keep mobile users connected to the Internet and IP-based applications.

We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.<br><br>If you join us, you\u2019ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we\u2019re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries and have people that used to work at Telenor, Google, Microsoft, and AWS. We promise that you\u2019ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a \u201cstart-up for grown-ups\u201d. We know where we\u2019re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we\u2019ll pave the way there together.<br><br>We\u2019re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 10 countries). We\u2019ll pay for your phone and internet, as well as your lunch and office snacks. We\u2019ll even pay you for your work! The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks, demos, and failure fridays. We have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun. Every year we also have a company wide off-site where we spend a whole week together share ideas and have fun.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What\'s next?</strong><br>If you\u2019re interested in working with us, please apply through the link below, or you can contact Marietta for any questions on marietta@wgtwo.com</span>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}')}}]);

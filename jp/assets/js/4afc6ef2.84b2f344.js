We will make this happen by enabling third party developers to create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.</p><p>Our goal is to create a product ecosystem, which consists of three main components:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A developer portal:</strong> Enabling developers to use APIs and media streams for Messaging, Data, and Voice, and to submit their product to our marketplace.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>An operator marketplace:</strong> Allowing mobile operators to buy, manage, and distribute products to their subscribers.</p></li><li><p><strong>A subscriber marketplace:</strong> Letting mobile subscribers find, activate and launch the products they want to add to their subscription.</p></li></ul><br><p><strong>THE POSITION</strong></p><p>We\u2019re looking for a fullstack developer preferably with product experience, to help us build our Developer Portal. The Developer Portal team currently consists of two other fullstack developers, a designer, a UX researcher, and a product owner. Your main responsibilities will be writing code and sparring with your coworkers.
